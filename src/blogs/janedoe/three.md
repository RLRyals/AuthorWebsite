Decoding the Hidden Message 🔍
I couldn't shake off the intrigue. Setting aside my plans for the morning, I spread the note out on the dining table and stared at it. Where shadows dwell? I muttered under my breath.

As a mystery writer, I've crafted countless puzzles and riddles for my characters. Now, it seemed, the universe was flipping the script on me.

I grabbed a notepad and started jotting down possibilities.

Old Library Basement: The basement of our town's library was notorious for its eerie atmosphere.
Shadow Lake Pier: At noon, the tall trees cast long shadows over the pier.
The Abandoned Theater: A relic from the 1920s, now a playground for urban explorers.
After weighing the options, I decided the most plausible place was the Old Clock Tower in the town square. It was the only clock that actually "struck twelve" with chimes loud enough to hear across town.
