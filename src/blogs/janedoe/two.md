The Curious Case of the Unmarked Envelope ✉️
Now, I've received my fair share of unsolicited mail—bills, promotional flyers, you name it. But this envelope was different. It was thick, made of high-quality parchment, and completely devoid of any markings. No stamp, no address, nothing.

Curiosity piqued, I picked it up and examined it closely. Maybe it's a misdeliver— but before I could finish that thought, a faint scent of lavender wafted up from the paper. Odd.

I tore it open carefully, half-expecting to find some generic letter inside. Instead, there was a single sheet of paper with a cryptic message:

"When the clock strikes twelve, meet me where shadows dwell."

Well, that's not ominous at all! I chuckled nervously. Was this some kind of prank? Maybe one of my friends was trying to inject a bit of excitement into my monotonous routine.
